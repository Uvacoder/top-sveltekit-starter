    eScience Center</a> are hosting a two-day international workshop to set the future agenda for national and international funders to support sustainable
    research software.<br> <br>As the importance of software in research has become increasingly apparent, so has the urgent need to sustain it. Funders can
    play a crucial role in this respect by ensuring structural support. Over the past few years, a variety of methods for sustaining research software have been
    explored, including improving and extending funding policies and instruments. During the workshop, funding organizations will join forces to explore how
    they can effectively contribute to making research software sustainable.<br> <br>Additional support to increase accessibility will be available on request.
    Online opportunities will be provided to contribute to discussions around and during the conference, and recordings of the plenary presentations will be
    made available.<br> <br>Please note this workshop is open to national research funding organizations, by invitation. If you are interested in attending but
    have not received an invitation, please contact us at

    In this modern age, research is nearly impossible to do without research software. One of top priorities at the Netherlands eScience Center has always been
    to obtain recognition for research software and the role of research software engineers (RSEs) behind it. But the world of research is international, and
    pulling this off on a global level requires the minds of many experts across many institutions to work together.

        The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchsoft.org/">Research Software Alliance (ReSA)</a> is an international community of professionals whose
        mission is to “bring research software communities together
        to collaborate on the advancement of the research software ecosystem.” Together, they ensure that “research software and those who develop and maintain
        it are recognized and valued as fundamental and vital to research worldwide.”
        <br><br>
        The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.esciencecenter.nl/">Netherlands eScience Center</a> is a research organization that since 2012 has been
        uniquely positioned as an independent foundation, financed by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) and the Dutch organization for IT in
        education and research (SURF). It is the national centre with the digital skills to create innovative software solutions in academic software. The core
        activities of the eScience Center are carried out by Research Software Engineers (RSEs) who are high-end, university-level specialists who do two
        things: they do research using digital technologies and methodologies, and they engineer software.
