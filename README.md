## Motivation and Personal Opinion

Svelte is the future, there is no other way. And having a clone-and-run repo with everything a basic web application needs is the best way to get started, spread the word, and create an even bigger ecosystem.

## Installation and running locally

```bash
npx degit ctwhome/top-sveltekit <directory-name>
pnpm install
```

## Updating fork

1.  Add remote from the original repository in your forked repository:

```shell
git remote add upstream git://github.com/ctwhome/top-sveltekit.git
git fetch upstream
```

1.  Updating your fork from the original repo to keep up with their changes:  
    `git pull upstream main`

Start the development server on [http://localhost:5137](http://localhost:3000)

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## IDE

We recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with eslint and prettier (Tailwindcss plugging to organize the classes )

Recommended plugins popup

## Production

Depending on the adaptor you choose, either SSR, SSG...etc

```bash
pnpm build
```
